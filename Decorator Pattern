in decorator pattern we have a base object. and if we want some addition feature then we decorate it with new feature.

suppose f1 is base object. then we want add f2 feature in it.

then new object will be f1 + f2.


Use case:

1. Pizza shop
  we have a base pizza.
  
  we can decorate it with toppings.
  
  
  
  the benefit of decorator is class explosion. suppose with base object you have 5 extra feature. then there will 5! possibilities to get each different 
  object.
  
  how to create decorator pattern?
  
  we have a base class (abstract class)
